`Artificial Slime` is a NFT social platform.

After creating user accout you will be given the ability to like and own any NFT you want as well as leave comments.

Creating account also gives you the ability to create NFT's and after creating one you forever become its owner and you can
later go back and edit it as much as you like.

Users own their own Profile page which is shared on the profile-list page with everyone else.
Here people can see which NFT's you own and like as well as your name and description.

After succesfull login/register from your own profile page you will be able to edit you
username and description as well as to choose for your profile picture from the list of
NFT's you own.

For the guess you can still see user-list and catalog as well as individual user profiles,
but you can't own and like NFT's as well as to leave comments.
Guest can create and edit NFT's and don't own a profile page soo they can't leave a trace
on the website
